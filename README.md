# About Me

Hi, I'm Costa! I’m a product-minded mobile engineer with over 15 years of experience building across the stack. My career has been focused on owning entire ecosystems -- from native mobile clients to the backend services that power them -- with an emphasis on technical craft and long-term maintainability.

## How I Build

My engineering philosophy is centered on building systems that are predictable, scalable, and easy to reason about.

* **Testing First**: I treat automated testing as a core part of the development process, not an afterthought. I advocate for a balanced strategy of unit, integration, and UI tests to ensure that business logic is verified and regressions are caught early.
* **Fundamental Dependency Injection**: I believe in a strong understanding of DI fundamentals. While DI frameworks have their place in larger codebases, I prefer an approach where dependencies are clearly defined and manually injected where possible to keep the architecture transparent, decoupled, and easy to test.
* **Unidirectional Data Flow (UDF)**: I utilize reactive, UDF patterns to maintain a single source of truth for application state, which significantly reduces side effects and state-related bugs in complex mobile UIs.
* **Modular Architecture**: I prioritize clear boundaries between networking, data persistence, and the UI layer to allow teams to move fast without accumulating technical debt.

## Featured Sample Projects

I built these "Library" apps as architectural blueprints to demonstrate how I approach a modern mobile project from the ground up. While the features are straightforward, the implementation is designed to handle production-level complexity.

These sister apps showcase a consistent architectural philosophy across platforms:

* **Tech**: SwiftUI / Jetpack Compose with Combine / Coroutines.
* **Patterns**: Repository pattern for managing local persistence and remote API data.
* **Quality**: Comprehensive testing suites demonstrating how to verify business logic and UI state.
* **Key Focus**: Robust error handling, loading state management, and clear dependency management.
    
## Let's Connect

I'm always happy to discuss mobile architecture, testing strategies, or the trade-offs of different technical approaches. If you're interested in my work or have questions about these sample projects, feel free to reach out.
