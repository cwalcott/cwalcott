## About Me

Hi! I'm Costa, a mobile, web and backend developer from the Greater Boston area.

Senior Engineer with 15+ years of experience owning and shipping end-to-end, mobile-centric
products. Extensive background in native iOS and Android development, backed by hands-on
ownership of backend services and web dashboards. Known for clean architecture, maintainable
code, strong architectural judgment, and pragmatic decision-making. Comfortable moving across
platforms as product needs evolve in small, fast-moving teams.

## Sample Code

MyLibrary is a small personal library manager app that allows users to search for books using the Open Library API and save favorites locally.

I've written this app in native iOS and native Android. Both platforms demonstrate clean architecture, comprehensive testing, and reactive unidirectional data flow practices. This project showcases integration of local persistence, networking, reactive programming, and dependency injection in a production-ready codebase.
